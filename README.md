# poker-calculator
A simple calculator to help figure out winnings split in a game of poker, based on the number of players and the total amount of money.

Planned additions and updates include:
- Adding error checks (ex. entering an amount that isn't either a whole integer or a decimal value with exactly two decimal places)
- Options for blind values and chip distribution
- Conversion to an app form (whether it's a web app, mobile app, or desktop app is still up in the air)
